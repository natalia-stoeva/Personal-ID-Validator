# Bulgarian personal identity number validator
Live preview here: https://egn-validator.netlify.app/

 ## Overview
 
The Identity Number Validator is created using javascript and the [following algorithm](https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80).

## Features 
* Uses an algorithm to check wheter the provided personal ID is correct.
* Display information about the date of birth, the region of birth, and the sex of the individual. 

## Resources 
I used [this PHP code](https://georgi.unixsol.org/programs/egn.php) as a reference.

## Future improvements
- Generate Personal ID
- Calculate the birth number
